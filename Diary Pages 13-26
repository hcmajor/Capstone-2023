					The Svoboda Diaries Project began in 2006 as a project under the umbrella of the Ottoman Texts Archive Project (OTAP). Throughout the projectâ€™s history, we have focused on the digitization of the journals of two members of the Svoboda family, Joseph Svoboda and his son Alexander. The Joseph Mathia Svoboda diaries capture over 40 years of trade on the Tigris, life, politics, and the landscape of Ottoman Iraq through the perspective of a British steamship purser with a rich family history and local connections.

					In Diary 61, Joseph Svoboda details the events in his private life between December 1907 through January 1908, and Alexander Svoboda continues writing until the end of the year.  A majority of the diary consists of Joseph detailing the illnesses of various family members until he himself dies on January 19th, 1908.

					me yesterday being given to
					<lb n="6"/>
					him by his nephew Addai,
					<lb n="7"/>

					<lb n="9"/>

					<lb n="10"/>
					called Mohamed ibu Hessony
					<lb n="11"/>
					Abode Kerop's house, &amp; told him

					his cultivation he brought him
					<lb n="14"/>
					back to me at my door &amp;
					<lb n="15"/>
					made an awful raw, he
					<lb n="16"/>
					wanted to know who brought
					<lb n="17"/>
					it to me, Jassim said that
					<lb n="18"/>
					he had bought it from a Jew,
					<lb n="19"/>
					he wont believe it &amp; insisted
					<lb n="20"/>
					on his demand; &amp; would
					<lb n="21"/>
					not listen to me, that I should
					<lb n="22"/>
					make enquiries &amp; find out
					<lb n="23"/>
					if it is stolen from him,

					but he accompanied me

					<lb n="27"/>
					forward &amp; brought a zaptyeh

					enraged &amp; ennerved, I
					<lb n="4"/>
					threatened to complain in
					<lb n="5"/>
					Baghdad if he does not shut
					<lb n="6"/>

					<lb n="7"/>
					Mohamed that, as I  promised
					<lb n="8"/>
					to make enquiries, to let the

					<lb n="10"/>

					<lb n="12"/>
					very tired &amp; enraged at what
					<lb n="13"/>
					had passed on account of
					<lb n="14"/>
					a  miserable cabbige; I heard
					<lb n="15"/>
					that sister Eliza is just the
					<lb n="16"/>
					same as before, we then
					<lb n="17"/>
					went to see her, she is weaker
					<lb n="18"/>
					&amp; would not take any nourishment.
					<lb n="19"/>
					She appears to be sinking &amp; no hope
					<lb n="20"/>
					of her recovery, as also the Doctors
					<lb n="21"/>
					had said so.~ We then went
					<lb n="22"/>
					to see my wife, she is also suffering,
					<lb n="23"/>
					Rufail was there; Dr. Nizam el Din
					<lb n="24"/>
					had been to see her &amp; prescribed
					<lb n="25"/>
					medicines, she has pain on the 
					<lb n="26"/>
					chest &amp; back, at <time when="06:00:00">6 p.m.</time> We came
					<lb n="27"/>
					home; I feel so unwell and
