           The Svoboda Diaries Project began in 2006 as a project under the umbrella of the Ottoman Texts Archive Project (OTAP). Throughout the projectâ€™s history, we have focused on the digitization of the journals of two members of the Svoboda family, Joseph Svoboda and his son Alexander. The Joseph Mathia Svoboda diaries capture over 40 years of trade on the Tigris, life, politics, and the landscape of Ottoman Iraq through the perspective of a British steamship purser with a rich family history and local connections.

              In Diary 61, Joseph Svoboda details the events in his private life between December 1907 through January 1908, and Alexander Svoboda continues writing until the end of the year.  A majority of the diary consists of Joseph detailing the illnesses of various family members until he himself dies on January 19th, 1908.
